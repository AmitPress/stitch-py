# StitchUP - Rollup for Python

This package works similar to rollup js. It does not give so much flexibility and features as rollup but it aspires to do that. With this package you can resolve necessary `Function`s and `Class`es with an inplace replacement.

This particular package can be very useful if you do competitive programming. There you can just include the pre-written solution and it will sum all up to one file only.

There are some limitations as of now but will be worked on in future.
